--> I am an aspiring web developer with a passion for building high-quality, user-friendly websites and web applications. I have a strong foundation in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, and am always eager to learn and grow in my field.

Previously, I was a traveller, worked as a junior engineer officer in the maritime industry :ship::luggage:. I have a Bachelor Degree in mechanical engineering. I travelled all round the world :smile:, but the life at sea didn't suit me right, and
decided I should focus on what I can do better: working in IT development.

I got into development in 2021, and started learning from scratch since then: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

For now I have successfuly completed an e-commerce site through React.js framework including HTML, CSS, and different JavaScript codes with authentication and payment functionality (which I struggled a bit to find solutions, but in the end I finally reached to the desired result). I used primarily React.js with javascript contexts and even learned about Redux and implemented into my projects.

I'm eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, into becomaing a succeeding developer. I'm polishing my skills learnt throughout online courses.

In addition to my work as a developer, I am also interested in exploring new technologies and innovations, such as blockchain development. I am currently studying Solidity and learning about the potential applications of blockchain technology. I am excited to see where my passions and interests will take me in the future.

I'm always trying to grow, and excited to learn new things as time goes by. I want to put my works to good use. 

My hobby is music, I'm a composer and a producer, I like to play the piano and make electronic music tracks for the people :notes:. 

### What I'm focusing on!
 - currently building my own complex project with Next.js and React on an e-commerce store and blog.
 - improving my skills in React.js, Next.js, hardhat and Solidity.
