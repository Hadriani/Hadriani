--> I am a Junior / Blockchain Web Developer with a passion for building high-quality, user-friendly websites and web applications. I have a based foundation in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, Next.js, Solidity, Hardhat, and am always eager to learn and grow in my field.

Previously, I was a traveller, worked as a junior engineer officer in the maritime industry :ship::luggage:. I have a Bachelor Degree in mechanical/electrical engineering. I travelled all round the world :smile:, but the life at sea didn't suit me right, and
decided I should focus on what I can do better: working in IT development.

I got into development in 2021, and started learning from scratch since then: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

For now I have successfuly completed 2 dApps in blockchain development using web3.js, Solidity, Hardhat deployment and more, 2 e-commerce sites (one of them is in progress) through Next.js / React.js framework including HTML, CSS, and different JavaScript codes with authentication and payment functionality (which I struggled a bit to find solutions, but in the end I finally reached to the desired result). I use primarily Next.js in my projects.

I'm eager to learn new technologies and frameworks, into becomaing a succeeding developer. I'm polishing my skills learnt throughout online courses.

In addition to my work as a developer, I am also interested in exploring new technologies and innovations, such as blockchain development. 
I'm always trying to grow, and excited to learn new things as time goes by. I want to put my works to good use. 

My hobby is music, I'm a composer and a producer, I like to play the piano and make electronic music tracks for the people :notes:. 
On the left I have a link to my portfolio site, as well as my LinkedIn profile. 

### What I'm focusing on!
 - improving my skills in React.js, Next.js, CSS, Javascript, Hardhat and Solidity;
