--> I am an aspiring web developer looking forward to learn, grow and find a purpose within this community. I stand for innovation, quality and excited to learn new technologies that will benefit us much more, and bring the desired products to the people. 

Previously, I was a traveller, worked as a junior engineer officer in the maritime industry :ship::luggage:. I have a Bachelor Degree in mechanical engineering. I travelled all round the world :smile:, but the life at sea didn't suit me right, and
decided I should focus on what I can do better: working in IT, web programming. 

I got into programming in 2021, and started learning from scratch since then: HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, Solidity (how to create websites: e-commerce stores, blogs, and more). 
I'm amazed about the new technologies and innovations that are evolving by each day.
Blockchain technology is one of the most important things that fascinates me, and by curiosity I'm delving into this area of work very deeply. Crypto :yellow_circle: and NFTs are somewhat to watch for in the future, and the benefits of the blockchain technology that brings us.

I'm always trying to grow, and excited to learn new things as time goes by. I want to put my works to good use. 

My hobby is music, I'm a composer and a producer, I like to play the piano and make electronic music tracks for the people :notes:. 

### What I'm focusing on!
 - currently improving my skills in React.js, hardhat and Solidity.
